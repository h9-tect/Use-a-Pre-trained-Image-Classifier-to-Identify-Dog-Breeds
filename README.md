# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds

This project is part of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created an image classifier using a pre-trained model to identify different dog breeds. The classifier takes an input image and predicts the breed of the dog present in the image. The project consists of the following main components:

 Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained deep learning model, such as VGG16, ResNet50, or CNN, is used as the base for the image classifier. 

. Training the Classifier: The custom classifier is trained using the training set of dog images.
